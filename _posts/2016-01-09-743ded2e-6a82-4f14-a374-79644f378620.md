Branded Man - visualizing depression and rebirth

There are stories, and then there are STORIES. That feeling when you read something that resonates with your own experiences or what is happening in your life. Sometimes because you know the person who is telling the story or the story itself just touches you. Or sometimes the time is just right.

Story about the "branded man" (written by Veera Tyhtil√§) came to me at the turning point of my life; I had just come back from one year trip to UK, searching for a direction in my life. I read the story right after it was published in August 2015, but the meaning of the story in my own life came apparent to me when Toni asked me to visualize the story.
